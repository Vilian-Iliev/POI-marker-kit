# `capture-motion-gate.ts`

- **Purpose:** the policy that decides whether a _due_ image capture fires on
  the current frame or is deferred until device motion settles, so that
  motion-blurred frames are skipped.

- **Public API:**
  - `decideCapture(input): 'capture' | 'defer'` — stateless decision over
    `{ windowMaxAngular, windowMaxLinear, maxAngularVelocity, maxLinearVelocity,
msSinceDue, maxWaitMs }`.
    - Returns `'capture'` when both windowed maxima are at/below their
      thresholds (calm), OR when `msSinceDue >= maxWaitMs` (never-calm safety
      fallback). Otherwise `'defer'`.
  - `class MotionWindow(size?, angularGlitchCeiling?, linearGlitchCeiling?)` —
    fixed-size ring of recent valid velocity pairs.
    - `push(angularVel, linearVel): boolean` — records a sample; returns
      `false` and stores nothing if it exceeds a glitch ceiling or is
      non-finite.
    - `maxAngular()` / `maxLinear()` — max over the window, or `Infinity` when
      empty (so "no data" reads as not-calm).
    - `reset()` — clear (on tracking loss / capture restart).
  - Constants: `DEFAULT_MOTION_WINDOW_SIZE` (3), `ANGULAR_GLITCH_CEILING_RAD_S`
    (50), `LINEAR_GLITCH_CEILING_M_S` (20).

- **Invariants & assumptions:**
  - **Empty window ⇒ `Infinity` ⇒ not calm.** No capture can fire before at
    least one valid sample exists (except via the `maxWaitMs` fallback).
  - **Glitch rejection never pollutes the window.** A relocalization spike is
    dropped, so it cannot force a spurious defer; the manager additionally
    refuses to capture _on_ a glitch frame (see `image-capture.ts`).
  - The gate **only ever delays** a capture; it never advances one.
  - Window size + glitch ceilings are internal constants, not user config — the
    user surface is only `enabled`/`maxAngular`/`maxLinear`/`maxWaitMs`.
  - Both windowed maxima are compared (not the instantaneous linear sample) so
    linear motion is judged as robustly as angular (plan §4.2).

- **Examples:**

  ```ts
  const win = new MotionWindow();
  win.push(0.2, 0.1); // valid
  win.push(1000, 0); // glitch -> rejected, returns false
  decideCapture({
    windowMaxAngular: win.maxAngular(),
    windowMaxLinear: win.maxLinear(),
    maxAngularVelocity: 0.6,
    maxLinearVelocity: 0.5,
    msSinceDue: 0,
    maxWaitMs: 4000,
  }); // 'capture' (calm)
  ```

- **Tests:** `capture-motion-gate.test.ts` — calm→capture, fast→defer, fallback
  fires at `maxWaitMs`, glitch rejected without polluting the window, empty
  window not calm.
