/**
 * Occluder mesh driver — main-thread orchestration for the Web Worker offload.
 *
 * Drives {@link packMeshRequest} / {@link runMeshRequest} (see
 * `2026-07-01-occluder-worker-and-chunked-remesh-plan.md`): the occluder wiring
 * calls {@link OccluderMeshDriver.request} on each refresh with the occupied-cell
 * snapshot; the driver packs it, posts it to a worker, and invokes a callback
 * with the meshed geometry when it returns — so the expensive mesh runs
 * off-thread and never stalls the render.
 *
 * Policy (locked 2026-07-01):
 * - **Coalesce to latest** — at most one job in flight; a request made while busy
 *   is remembered (newest wins) and posted when the current one returns, so work
 *   never queues up behind a growing grid.
 * - **Synchronous fallback** — constructed with `poster = null` (no worker
 *   support), it meshes inline and calls back immediately (today's behaviour).
 * - **Error recovery (2026-07-01 Phase 1 gap fix)** — a worker that never replies
 *   (an uncaught throw in `runMeshRequest`, or a module that fails to load) must
 *   not wedge the in-flight slot forever. On a worker error the driver clears the
 *   slot and re-posts the pending snapshot (or lets the next refresh post) so the
 *   occluder never silently freezes. If the worker errors **before ever producing
 *   a mesh** — almost always a load failure — the driver declares it unusable
 *   ({@link OccluderMeshDriverOptions.onWorkerUnusable}) and switches to
 *   synchronous main-thread meshing, since further posts would vanish into a dead
 *   worker.
 *
 * Framework-owned + THREE-free: a consumer supplies a {@link MeshWorkerPoster}
 * adapting a real `Worker`, and applies the result (e.g. `OcclusionMesh.applyMeshData`).
